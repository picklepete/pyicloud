# Reasons disabled:
# format - handled by black
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# inconsistent-return-statements - doesn't handle raise
# unnecessary-pass - readability for functions which only contain pass
# useless-object-inheritance - should be removed while droping Python 2
# wrong-import-order - isort guards this
