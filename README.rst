PyiCloud is a module which allows pythonistas to interact with iCloud webservices. It's powered by the fantastic `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ HTTP library.

At its core, PyiCloud connects to iCloud using your username and password, then performs calendar and iPhone queries against their API.

==============
Authentication
==============

Authentication without using a saved password is as simple as passing your username and password to the ``PyiCloudService`` class:

>>> from pyicloud import PyiCloudService
>>> api = PyiCloudService('jappleseed@apple.com', 'password')

In the event that the username/password combination is invalid, a ``PyiCloudFailedLoginException`` exception is thrown.

You can also store your password in the system keyring using the command-line tool:

>>> icloud --username=jappleseed@apple.com
ICloud Password for jappleseed@apple.com:
Save password in keyring? (y/N)

If you have stored a password in the keyring, you will not be required to provide a password when interacting with the command-line tool or instantiating the ``PyiCloudService`` class for the username you stored the password for.

>>> api = PyiCloudService('jappleseed@apple.com')

If you would like to delete a password stored in your system keyring, you can clear a stored password using the ``--delete-from-keyring`` command-line option:

>>> icloud --username=jappleseed@apple.com --delete-from-keyring

**Note**: Authentication will expire after an interval set by Apple, at which point you will have to re-authenticate. This interval is currently two months.

************************************************
Two-step and two-factor authentication (2SA/2FA)
************************************************

If you have enabled `two-step authentication (2SA) <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152>`_ for the account you will have to do some extra work:

.. code-block:: python

	if api.requires_2sa:
	    import click
	    print "Two-step authentication required. Your trusted devices are:"

	    devices = api.trusted_devices
	    for i, device in enumerate(devices):
	        print "  %s: %s" % (i, device.get('deviceName',
	            "SMS to %s" % device.get('phoneNumber')))

	    device = click.prompt('Which device would you like to use?', default=0)
	    device = devices[device]
	    if not api.send_verification_code(device):
	        print "Failed to send verification code"
	        sys.exit(1)

	    code = click.prompt('Please enter validation code')
	    if not api.validate_verification_code(device, code):
	        print "Failed to verify verification code"
	        sys.exit(1)

This approach also works if the account is set up for `two-factor authentication (2FA) <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915>`_, but the authentication will time out after a few hours. Full support for two-factor authentication (2FA) is not implemented in PyiCloud yet. See issue `#102 <https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/issues/102>`_.


=======
Devices
=======

You can list which devices associated with your account by using the ``devices`` property:

>>> api.devices
{
u'i9vbKRGIcLYqJnXMd1b257kUWnoyEBcEh6yM+IfmiMLh7BmOpALS+w==': <AppleDevice(iPhone 4S: Johnny Appleseed's iPhone)>,
u'reGYDh9XwqNWTGIhNBuEwP1ds0F/Lg5t/fxNbI4V939hhXawByErk+HYVNSUzmWV': <AppleDevice(MacBook Air 11": Johnny Appleseed's MacBook Air)>
}

and you can access individual devices by either their index, or their ID:

>>> api.devices[0]
<AppleDevice(iPhone 4S: Johnny Appleseed's iPhone)>
>>> api.devices['i9vbKRGIcLYqJnXMd1b257kUWnoyEBcEh6yM+IfmiMLh7BmOpALS+w==']
<AppleDevice(iPhone 4S: Johnny Appleseed's iPhone)>

or, as a shorthand if you have only one associated apple device, you can simply use the ``iphone`` property to access the first device associated with your account:

>>> api.iphone
<AppleDevice(iPhone 4S: Johnny Appleseed's iPhone)>

Note: the first device associated with your account may not necessarily be your iPhone.

==============
Find My iPhone
==============

Once you have successfully authenticated, you can start querying your data!

********
Location
********

Returns the device's last known location. The Find My iPhone app must have been installed and initialized.

>>> api.iphone.location()
{u'timeStamp': 1357753796553, u'locationFinished': True, u'longitude': -0.14189, u'positionType': u'GPS', u'locationType': None, u'latitude': 51.501364, u'isOld': False, u'horizontalAccuracy': 5.0}

******
Status
******

The Find My iPhone response is quite bloated, so for simplicity's sake this method will return a subset of the properties.

>>> api.iphone.status()
{'deviceDisplayName': u'iPhone 5', 'deviceStatus': u'200', 'batteryLevel': 0.6166913, 'name': u"Peter's iPhone"}

If you wish to request further properties, you may do so by passing in a list of property names.

**********
Play Sound
**********

Sends a request to the device to play a sound, if you wish pass a custom message you can do so by changing the subject arg.

>>> api.iphone.play_sound()

A few moments later, the device will play a ringtone, display the default notification ("Find My iPhone Alert") and a confirmation email will be sent to you.

*********
Lost Mode
*********

Lost mode is slightly different to the "Play Sound" functionality in that it allows the person who picks up the phone to call a specific phone number *without having to enter the passcode*. Just like "Play Sound" you may pass a custom message which the device will display, if it's not overridden the custom message of "This iPhone has been lost. Please call me." is used.

>>> phone_number = '555-373-383'
>>> message = 'Thief! Return my phone immediately.'
>>> api.iphone.lost_device(phone_number, message)

========
Calendar
========

The calendar webservice currently only supports fetching events.

******
Events
******

Returns this month's events:

>>> api.calendar.events()

Or, between a specific date range:

>>> from_dt = datetime(2012, 1, 1)
>>> to_dt = datetime(2012, 1, 31)
>>> api.calendar.events(from_dt, to_dt)

Alternatively, you may fetch a single event's details, like so:

>>> api.calendar.get_event_detail('CALENDAR', 'EVENT_ID')

========
Contacts
========

You can access your iCloud contacts/address book through the ``contacts`` property:

>>> for c in api.contacts.all():
>>> print c.get('firstName'), c.get('phones')
John [{u'field': u'+1 555-55-5555-5', u'label': u'MOBILE'}]

Note: These contacts do not include contacts federated from e.g. Facebook, only the ones stored in iCloud.

=======================
File Storage (Ubiquity)
=======================

You can access documents stored in your iCloud account by using the ``files`` property's ``dir`` method:

>>> api.files.dir()
[u'.do-not-delete',
 u'.localized',
 u'com~apple~Notes',
 u'com~apple~Preview',
 u'com~apple~mail',
 u'com~apple~shoebox',
 u'com~apple~system~spotlight'
]

You can access children and their children's children using the filename as an index:

>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']
<Folder: u'com~apple~Notes'>
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes'].type
u'folder'
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes'].dir()
[u'Documents']
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents'].dir()
[u'Some Document']
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['Some Document'].name
u'Some Document'
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['Some Document'].modified
datetime.datetime(2012, 9, 13, 2, 26, 17)
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['Some Document'].size
1308134
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['Some Document'].type
u'file'

And when you have a file that you'd like to download, the ``open`` method will return a response object from which you can read the ``content``.

>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['Some Document'].open().content
'Hello, these are the file contents'

Note: the object returned from the above ``open`` method is a `response object <http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#classes>`_ and the ``open`` method can accept any parameters you might normally use in a request using `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_.

For example, if you know that the file you're opening has JSON content:

>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['information.json'].open().json()
{'How much we love you': 'lots'}
>>> api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['information.json'].open().json()['How much we love you']
'lots'

Or, if you're downloading a particularly large file, you may want to use the ``stream`` keyword argument, and read directly from the raw response object:

>>> download = api.files['com~apple~Notes']['Documents']['big_file.zip'].open(stream=True)
>>> with open('downloaded_file.zip', 'wb') as opened_file:
        opened_file.write(download.raw.read())

=======================
Photo Library
=======================

You can access the iCloud Photo Library through the ``photos`` property.

>>> api.photos.all
<PhotoAlbum: 'All Photos'>

Individual albums are available through the ``albums`` property:

>>> api.photos.albums['Screenshots']
<PhotoAlbum: 'Screenshots'>

Which you can iterate to access the photo assets.  The 'All Photos' album is sorted by `added_date` so the most recently added photos are returned first.  All other albums are sorted by `asset_date` (which represents the exif date) :

>>> for photo in api.photos.albums['Screenshots']:
        print photo, photo.filename
<PhotoAsset: id=AVbLPCGkp798nTb9KZozCXtO7jds> IMG_6045.JPG

To download a photo use the `download` method, which will return a `response object <http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#classes>`_, initialized with ``stream`` set to ``True``, so you can read from the raw response object:

>>> photo = next(iter(api.photos.albums['Screenshots']), None)
>>> download = photo.download()
>>> with open(photo.filename, 'wb') as opened_file:
        opened_file.write(download.raw.read())

Note: Consider using ``shutil.copyfile`` or another buffered strategy for downloading the file so that the whole file isn't read into memory before writing.

Information about each version can be accessed through the ``versions`` property:

>>> photo.versions.keys()
[u'medium', u'original', u'thumb']

To download a specific version of the photo asset, pass the version to ``download()``:

>>> download = photo.download('thumb')
>>> with open(photo.versions['thumb'].filename, 'wb') as thumb_file:
        thumb_file.write(download.raw.read())
